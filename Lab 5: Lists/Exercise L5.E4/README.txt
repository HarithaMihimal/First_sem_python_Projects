Develop a program to input a matrix with any dimension and output the transpose of that matrix. You should stop accepting the rows when -1 is entered as the input. Use a 2D (two-dimensional) list to store the matrix. You should handle the exceptions such as checking the invalid rows with an inconsistent number of elements.

Note: Print “Invalid Matrix” as the error message for invalid rows with an inconsistent number of elements. Print “Error” for any other exceptions you are handling.
