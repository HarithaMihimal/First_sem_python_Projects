Develop a program to read in two matrices A and B with dimensions n x m and compute and display their product ABᵀ (of dimensions n x n). Assume that the elements of the matrices are integers. You must use functions while implementing this program.

Note: You should check for any errors when entering the matrices. Print “Invalid Matrix” as the error message if the entered matrix does not comply with the given dimensions. Print “Error” for any other exceptions you are handling.
